This is plugin that initializes variables on the scope with Angular Classy.

```html
<script src="/bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
<script src="/bower_components/angular-classy/angular-classy.js"></script>
<script src="/bower_components/classy-computed/classy-initScope.js"></script>
```

## Running Tests

Download this repo, `cd` into the repo's directory then run:

```shell
npm install
npm install -g bower # If bower isn't already installed
bower install
npm test
```

### Simple initScope property

This makes $scope.cow to initialize as "bessie"

```javascript
app.classy.controller({
	
	// ...

	initScope: {
		cow: "bessie"
	}
});
```

### initScope property with function 

This is useful if you want to use services or do other initial work while setting the initial scope variables. 

```javascript
app.classy.controller({
	
	// ...

	initScope: function () {
	    var cowName = "bessie";
	    return {
	       cow: cowName
	    };
	}
});
```
